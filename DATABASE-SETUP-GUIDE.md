# Hat Rean Quiz Platform - Database Implementation Guide

## 🚀 Complete Database Setup for Supabase

This guide will help you implement a full-featured quiz platform with user authentication, progress tracking, admin controls, and session management.

## 📋 Prerequisites

1. **Supabase Account**: Create an account at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. **Project Setup**: Create a new Supabase project
3. **Environment Variables**: Ensure your `.env.local` file has:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
   ```

## 🗄️ Database Setup

### Step 1: Run the Database Schema

1. Open your Supabase project dashboard
2. Go to **SQL Editor**
3. Copy and paste the contents of `supabase-schema.sql`
4. Click **Run** to execute the schema

This will create:
- ✅ User profiles table with role management
- ✅ Categories for quiz topics
- ✅ Questions with multiple choice and true/false support
- ✅ Quiz sessions for admin-created quizzes
- ✅ User attempts and scoring system
- ✅ Statistics tracking per user and category
- ✅ Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- ✅ Automatic triggers for data updates

### Step 2: Create Your First Admin User

After signing up through your app:

1. Go to Supabase **Authentication** → **Users**
2. Find your user account
3. Go to **SQL Editor** and run:
   ```sql
   UPDATE public.user_profiles 
   SET role = 'admin' 
   WHERE id = 'your-user-id-here';
   ```
